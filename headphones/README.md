Headphones Website Implementation
This project involves implementing a responsive and accessible web page from a provided Figma design. The core objective is to achieve a pixel-perfect replication of the designer's vision using only HTML and CSS, strictly without the aid of any external CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap) or JavaScript.

Project Overview:

The website focuses on showcasing a "Headphones" product, featuring a comprehensive layout that includes:

- A responsive header with navigation.

- A "What We Do" section.

- An "Our Results" section.

- A "Contact Us" section.

- A robust footer.

- Visual enhancements like animations and background images implemented purely with CSS.

- A fully functional Hamburger Menu for mobile responsiveness, achieved without JavaScript.


Key Requirements & Constraints:

No External CSS Frameworks: All styling must be custom CSS.

No JavaScript: All interactivity (e.g., hamburger menu toggle) must be implemented using pure HTML/CSS techniques.

Figma Adherence: The implemented webpage must visually match the provided Figma design files as closely as possible.

Responsive Design: The webpage must adapt fluidly across different screen sizes.

It should switch to a mobile version when the screen width is 480px or less.

Accessibility: Best practices for web accessibility must be followed throughout the HTML structure and CSS styling.

Max Content Width: The main content area should have a maximum width of 1000px and be centered horizontally on the page.


Interaction Notes:

Links Hover/Active State: Apply #FF6565 color on hover and active states for all links.

Button Hover/Active State: Apply an opacity: 0.9 effect on hover and active states for all buttons.
